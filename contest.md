# JS 2025 Contest

Only the chat folders task was implemented in this submission.

The implementation was mostly done by adapting some components that were already found in the app. Modularity was 
a priority, with many of the components built for the implementation being designed to be reusable (like FolderIcon 
or FolderEmoticon).
